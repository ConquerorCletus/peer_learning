For learning purpose: In order to learn Object Oriented Programming, I thought 


A class ExamRecord should be created.
Properties of an ExamRecord
1.Student name
2.Number of Student
3.no of Subject/course
4.year of ExamRecord
5.Cumulative Grade point (average)


How I intend to go about it.
A class ExamRecord would be created.
A class variable no_of_students is needed, it is a record so it should reflect the number of student in the class.
A class variable no_of_subjects would be used to calculate the average.

would make more as we go.


Goal of Project.
The goal of the project is to make use of the Knowledge of OOP to build a Mini-ExamRecord
Knowledge of Class, method, Inheritance. would be used.


At the end of the Project, we should be able to confidently make use of OOP just as good as Procedural programming.


1. create a class ExamRecord
2. class variable no_of_subjects, no_of_students,

3. Define __init__ are year, student_name,


Add new student= no_of_students 
	ExamRecord.no_of_students+=1
	student_name = 



Add student name,year
calculate average_score
